* alignment
Given two sequences, an alignment is a correspondence between substrings of the two sequences.

* coreference
Similar strings that refer to the same entity

Ex: 
Stanford President John Hennessy
Stanford University President John Hennessy

* edit distance
Minimum edit distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of
editing operations (operations like insertion, deletion, substitution) needed to
transform one string into another.

* Levenshtein distance
each of insert, delete, and substitute has a cost of 1
